The current website (thousandbrains.org) is hosted on WordPress.  It has a number of drawbacks:

- A very basic two versioning system: live and staging.
- It costs money.
- Making updates requires a lot of manual, time consuming, error prone work.
- Global changes require manual updates to each page.
- There are security risks with the plugins on WordPress.
- The website is slow.
- There is a lot of cognitive load to figure out how to customize the website.
- It's closed source and goes against our open source philosophy.
